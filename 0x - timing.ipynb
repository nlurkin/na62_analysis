    "# Timing\n",
    "\n",
    "Timing in an experiment like NA62 is very different from other experiment such as LHC. For LHC experiments, the timing of the events is very well knows: one event comes every 25 ns. In NA62 we have a continuous beam of particle coming over periods of ~3 s (that we call burst or spill). During the burst we have about 750 MHz of particles entering the detector. Out of these, 6% are Kaons and only a fraction of them will decay in the fiducial decay volume. This means that every burst will see millions of Kaon decays and timing is therefore extremely important to be able to separate them. Different detectors will see different particle rates, but it is important to be able to consistently associate signals in time across all detectors, and therefore they should all have at least a resolution of the same order of magnitude. In the case of NA62, all detectors have a time resolution of better than ~1 ns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The timing intervenes at multiple levels in NA62. The first level is the trigger. A clock signal is is distributed through the whole experiment with a period of approximately 25 ns. This period defines what we call a \"frame\" and it is used as a reference for the generated triggers. Once a trigger is generated and distributed to all detectors, they will send all the signals they acquired in the reference frame (and a couple of frames on either side to ensure we have all we need before throwing it away). After further processing the data are written on disk. This trigger period, or frame, therefore defines the time window of each event. Within this time window, each detector has a faster clock defining a finer time (generally of the order of few 100 of ps). This fine time is the one that we will really use to associate in time signals in different detectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will investigate timing consideration. We have a few time variables in our data format and will we check how they correlate and how we can use it to remove spurious associations and reduce random veto (rejecting an event based on detector activity unrelated to the event of interest)."

    "## Track - MUV3 timing\n",
    "Let's first investigate the relationship between our track and the MUV3 signal. As you know, each track has a boolean variable indicating whether the track has MUV3 signal associated. However this association is spatial only, the timing is not considered. This means that a perfectly valid electron track may have a MUV3 (muon) signal associated. We know this is extremely unlikely that the electron itself leaves any signal on the MUV3. This situation can happen if a muon coming from the beam line hits the MUV3 at the same place as the electron would when we extrapolate its position on the MUV3. Given the rate of muons coming from the beam line, this situation is actually not unlikely. \n",
