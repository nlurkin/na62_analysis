    "However in this case computing the invariant mass will lead to similar result as for the total momentum: a continuous, non-peaking, distribution of event as the neutrino still takes away some of the energy. In the case of open decays, a better way is to look at the missing mass squared, which is computed as $m_\\text{miss}^2 = p_\\text{miss}^2 = (p_K - \\sum{p_i})^2$ where $p_K$ is the beam 4-momentum and $p_i$ are the 4-momenta of the detected decay products. To have a better intuition looking at this variable, we can also look at the missing mass (square root of the missing mass squared) however with the additional complication that $m_\\text{miss}^2$ can be negative. The square root for negative values is not well defined and results in complex number. Conventions could be to show then the absolute value (real part) of the mass (folding the negative part of the plot onto the positive part), or by convention to take the absolute value and keep the sign of the squared missing mass. This is the convention we are using in this code."

    "### Summary\n",
    "We have used above only kinematic arguments to isolate samples of our five major kaon decay channels. We have not computed the acceptance (fraction of signal events selected with respect to number of signal events present in the sample) nor the purity (1-fraction of selected background events) of our sample, but we can assume that this kind of selection does not yield the best results as we are not exploiting all the capabilities of our detector. This was nevertheless good enough to have sufficiently clear samples which allowed us to draw conclusions on the `event_type` and `rich_hypothesis` variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concerning the event_type, we have a total of six categories, but only five main decay channels. In fact the category '6' appears in all the samples we have isolated. We will consider this as unidentified background. In fact in the data that are made available for you, this category '6' are \"autopass\" events, meaning events that are randomly selected amongst those not belonging to any of the other categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the `rich_hypothesis`, the dataset provided would not allow us to determine what are the meaning of the values '0', '4', and '99' and furthemore you will likely have no use for these categories in the rest of this exercise so they are given to you. A `rich_hypothesis` of '0' represent \"background\", i.e. some signal in the detector that is not necessarily related to any particle passing through the detector (e.g. electronic noise) or when we are not able to determine reliably another category (for example if the particle is outside the useful momentum range). A value of '4' indicates a particle that is identified as a $K^\\pm$. In fact you can run the next cell to see that out of the few tracks that are present in the category '4' have mostly of momentum of 75 GeV/$c$, and probably correspond to beam kaon that are accidentaly associated to a vertex. Finally the category '99' correspond to signal where multiple tracks are on top of each other, rendering the identification impossible.\n",
