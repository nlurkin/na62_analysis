    "This notebook demonstrates the usage of the package over the simplified NA62 data format, using pandas dataframes. Kinematic techniques are used to perform kinematic selections. Through this you will understand how to use them and what powerful information they can provide. Through this we will also expose the meaning of some of the variables that are still mysterious  at this point.\n",

    "The na62 python package provides convenience functions in several modules as a good starting point:\n",
    " - prepare.py: This module provides functionalities to read the data from root files and produce a pandas dataframe that can be used for the analysis\n",
    " - extract.py: This module provides functionalities to extract some parts of the dataframe to manipulate them more easily (e.g. track, clusters\n",
    " - hlf.py: This module provides functions high level to compute higher level information for the event (e.g. total momentum, invariant mass, total LKr energy, ...). This is mostly an implementation of the exercises of the previous notebook.\n",
    " - constants.py: This module provides some useful constants (particle masses, detector geometry, ...)\n",
    " - stats.py: This module provides more advanced statistical functions (fitting, ...)"

    " - Second we have the k2pi decay, which is also observed as a single track. But the $\\pi^0$, which has a very small lifetime, decays on the stop primarily into two photons (98.8% BR). We should therefore detect in addition two photon clusters on the LKr whose invariant mass is the one of the $\\pi^0$, with the assumption that they come from the same vertex as the charged pion track.\n",
    " - Following at lower BR is the k3pi decay. It is observed as three tracks in the detector, all coming from a common vertex.\n",
    " - The ke3 and kmu3 decays have a much lower BR than k2pi, but with a similar topology: one charged track and two photon clusters with the $\\pi^0$ invariant mass. The only difference between the tracks are their nature, which can be reasonably well disentangled using particle identification (PID) techniques."

    "We can remember that the data available here contain mostly the five decay channels mentionned above. All other decay channels have such a small BR that we can expect at most a few events and we will therefore not be able to conclude anything from that at this point. Knowing this, we can start by creating **kinematic** selections (i.e. relying only on kinematic variables such as momentum, energy and combinations of those) to isolate a reasonably clean sample of the above decay channels. Once we have those samples, looking at the `event_type` and `rich_hypothesis` variables, we should be able to create a proper mapping for those values."
