    "Vectors are important variables. The flat datastructure cannot contain a vector object, so it is spread in the structure accross the four variables `[name]_direction{x,y,z}, [name]_momentum_mag` containing respectively the direction and the magnitude of the momentum (the direction vector is a unit vector i.e. with magnitude 1). `[name]` indicates the objects to which the momentum refers.\n",
    "As can be seen above, the data structure contains information about:\n",
    " - The event: run number, burst number, event_time. Those three values allow us to uniquely identify an event in the NA62 data. No two events will share the same triplet of values.\n",
    " - The beam: momentum, position at z=102.4m\n",
    " - Placeholder for three tracks (track1, track2, track3): for each of the track, a variable indicate if the track exists for the event. If the track exists, the information is filled about its momentum, time and charge, whether the track has associated MUV3 signal, RICH information (hypothesis, ring radius, position and number of hits), and the associated LKr energy. For convenience the EoP (energy over momentum) is already calculated and stored.\n",
    " - Similar placeholder for up to two clusters (cluster1, cluster2). If present, those clusters of energy on the LKr are not associated to one of the tracks, and the variables giving information about its energy, position on LKr front plane (na62.constants.lkr_position), and time are filled.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition each event was pre-identified and the variable `event_type` indicate which kaon decay channel was detected. Similarly for the `[name]_rich_hypothesis` variables indicating which is the most likely particle that was measured as a track.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the basic information that are reconstructed from (part) of the NA62 detector, and that will be enough for the kind of analysis that we want to do here. However we need to be able to combine these informations according to mathematical and physical principles that you know. The dataframe does not provide such facility so you have to develop that yourself as an exercises."
