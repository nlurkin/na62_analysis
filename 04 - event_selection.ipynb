    "## Data processing: from raw data to high-level objects\n",
    "The NA62 data, after being acquired, are first reconstructed. This means we take our raw (binary) data and we extract for each event the signals recorded for each detector individually. For each detectors, these signals are reconstructed as hits containing information like time, position, and geometrical channel ID (i.e. related to physical position rather than electronics position). Hits are further grouped together to reconstruct and form candidates: candidates are more complex objects generally meant to relate to a single particle interacting with the detector. These candidates can be referred to with other names for certain detectors: LKr -> cluster, Spectrometer -> track, GTK -> beam track.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the analysis level, candidates from multiple detectors can be associated together in space (geometrically) and in time to form higher level objects:\n",
    " - beam kaon: GTK track associated to a KTAG candidate\n",
    " - downstream track: spectrometer track associated to eventual candidates from CHOD, NewCHOD, MUV1-3, LKr, RICH\n",
    " - vertex: association between GTK and spectrometer tracks, or associated between spectrometer tracks only, or association between LKr clusters (neutral vertex)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pile-up\n",
    "As you may have guessed, the data presented to you here consist of events in the form of association of several of these high-level objects. However to reach that point, there has been already a sizable amount of selection performed at analysis level to make these associations. In fact one single event will usually consist in many more of those high-level objects coming from pile-up. Pile-up refers to valid events (either a beam kaon decay, a beam pion decay, a single beam muon) which are *not* (with caveat) related to the event that generated the trigger. In order to make sure we have **all** the information relating to that specific events, we are requesting signals from detector that are spread within ~100 ns of the trigger time. This means we have a lot of pile-up in each event, which is spread in time randomly within the event. But by applying timing cuts at the analysis level, we can easily discard a very large fraction of those pile-up events. There is still a small fraction of events remaining which happen to be at the same time as the triggered event. As it is not possible to distinguish it from the triggered event, additional selection criterion must be applied to ensure it is a valid kaon decay. As the pile-up event is at the same time as the kaon decay, we usually have several possibilities to combine the high-level objects. For instance, if you have one track and 3 isolated clusters and looking for a K2pi decay, you have three association possibilities for the clusters: combine clusters 1 and 2 to form a pi0, combines cluster 2 and 3, or combines clusters 1 and 3. This is called the combinatorics and you can apply conditions on each of all the possible options. If you manage to find a single option that satisfies all your requirements, this could be the correct one and you go ahead forming an event with this selection of high-level object. If not you usually reject the event.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process of eliminating the pile-up has already been done for you in the data that are available here, and this is the reason why each of your event has only one to three tracks and zero to two clusters. There remains one category of pile-up contaminating your sample (the caveat mentionned above): events that are **not** a kaon decay, but a combination of independent particles that look like a kaon decay. These required additional selection criterion, some of those have already been applied and some that we can apply ourselves in these data."
