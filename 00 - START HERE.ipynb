    "The available notebooks are:\n",
    " - [01 - data_manipulation.ipynb](./01%20-%20data_manipulation.ipynb): This notebook will explain what data are available and their format. There are some exercises to implement some higher level functions that will help you to manipulate them.\n",
    " - [02 - kinematic_selection.ipynb](./02%20-%20kinematic_selection.ipynb): Once the barrier of the data format passed, this will guide you through writing some simple selection based on kinematics only, to identify and understand more about the physics of the available data. \n",
    " - [03 - pid.ipynb](./03%20-%20pid.ipynb): This notebook is dedicated to Particle Identification (PID) techniques. How they are performed in the specific case of NA62 and what are their limitation. This will be useful for later.\n",
    " - [04 - timing.ipynb](./04%20-%20timing.ipynb): This notebook will explain why timing is important in NA62 and how to use it based on empirical observations.\n",
    " - [05 - resolution.ipynb](./05%20-%20resolution.ipynb): This notebook is dedicated to checking the resolution of the measurements of two essential detectors: the LKr and the Straw.\n",
